# Solved pre-release materials
As part of the IGCSE 0478 and A Level 9608 syllabuses, I had to complete tasks from pre-release material. I decided to document extensively document my work, and they are available here, as examples.

I've indicated the version of Python I used for these, but for the most part, you only have to make sure that the first digit (2 or 3) is right.
