# Pseudocode syntax highlighting plug-in
While working with pseudocode, I was disappointed by the lack of an editor (that uses CAIE syntax). So I built my own plugin for the popular editor [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/). Visit its GitHub repository from the button below.

[Pseudocode syntax highlighting](https://github.com/eccentricOrange/NPP-CAIE-Pseudocode-Highlighting-plugin){: .btn }

Notepad++ is a text editor and source code editor for use with Microsoft Windows. Notepad++ makes it possible to define "languages", or more precisely, highlighting schemes (UDLs). This pseudocode plug-in is a custom-defined-language that provides syntax highlighting. It has been built for the Computer Science syllabuses of Cambridge International Assessment Education, specifically A Level 9608 and IGCSE 0478.
