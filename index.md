# Resources for CAIE Computer Science (0478, 9608)

### Disclaimer about all resources here
While all reasonable efforts have been made to ensure full compatibility with the syllabuses (and the author himself uses these for their own assignments and practice), none of these are official resources nor have they been endorsed by Cambridge International Assessment Education for any syllabus. Please use them at your own discretion. The author will not be responsible for any syllabus mismatches.

## About the author
I love robotics, and Computer Science was a natural choice for me at IGCSE and A Level. I scored an A* at IGCSE, and predict the same at A Level. I built some tools and wrote notes to aide my learning journey, but documented them thoroughly so that they can be published (on this page!). Some YouTube channels were particularly useful to me, and the hope is that some students/teachers can re-discover their passion for computers through these resources, and get assistance getting the scores they desire. All sorts of feedback and suggestions are welcome, and may be submitted by [opening an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue) or [pulling a request](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) on GitHub.
