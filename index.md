# About

## About this page, and its author
I love robotics, and Computer Science was a natural choice for me at IGCSE and A Level (I scored A* at both). I built some tools and wrote notes to aide my learning journey, and documented them thoroughly so that they can be published (on this page!). The hope is that some students/teachers can re-discover their passion for computers through these resources, and get assistance obtaining the grade they deserve. All sorts of feedback and suggestions are welcome, and may be submitted by [opening an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue) or [pulling a request](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) on the repository for this page via GitHub.

### Disclaimer about all resources here
While all reasonable efforts have been made to ensure full compatibility with the syllabuses (and the author himself uses these for their own practice and study), these are **not official** resources and have not been endorsed by Cambridge International Assessment Education for any syllabus. Please use them at your own discretion. The author will not be responsible for any syllabus mismatches.

### Sponsoring: finances shouldn't be a factor in learning
I often link to or recommend external sources (these may take the form of tools, vidoes, and articles, among others). I do this when I believe that source is relevant and can potentially help the learners. Nothing is ever sponsored in any way, and the original creators have not requested to be listed (although I seek permission when needed). There are no affiliate links on this website (although I cannot speak for any source I link to). Should this ever change, it will be clearly marked as such.

If you do ever find something on this website that violates this, please open an issue or a pull request to let me know about my mistakes.
