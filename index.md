# 9608, 0478: Programming and Problem-solving

## Tools of the programming trade

Often, computer science courses teach you the theory of computing, programming, and all sorts of advanced topics. However, I've noticed a lack of resources that tell you how to actually tackle an IDE, how to keep track of your code, where to seek help et cetera.

If you're learning programming or computer science, these are some things you should consider using or exploring. Click below to read the article.

## Programming syllabus walk-throughs
I made two [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks that guide you through most of the Python programming topics. I try my best to
* cover fundamental areas that textbooks don't discuss adequately
* offer an alternate explanation, than those presented by most courses or textbooks
* talk generally about topics, so as to develop transferable skills
* prompt you to research and explore on your own
* provide silly examples.

The notebooks are also available using [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) and [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/), which can run in a web browser, so you don't have to install any software to view them. Binder is one of the recommended platforms for Jupyter notebooks.

These notebooks were originally designed for the [CAIE 9608 Computer Science](https://www.cambridgeinternational.org/programmes-and-qualifications/cambridge-international-as-and-a-level-computer-science-9608/) syllabus. However, they have been updated to cover the following CAIE syllabuses:
* IGCSE 0478
* IGCSE 0984
* AS & A Level 9608
* AS & A Level 9618

## Solved pre-release materials
As part of the IGCSE 0478 and A Level 9608 syllabuses, I had to complete tasks from pre-release material. I decided to document extensively document my work, and they are available here, as examples.

## Pseudocode syntax highlighting plug-in
While working with pseudocode, I was disappointed by the lack of an editor (that uses CAIE syntax). So I built my own plugin for the popular editor [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/). Visit its GiHub repository from the button below.

[Pseudocode syntax highlighting](https://github.com/eccentricOrange/NPP-CAIE-Pseudocode-Highlighting-plugin){: .btn }

Notepad++ is a text editor and source code editor for use with Microsoft Windows. Notepad++ makes it possible to define "languages", or more precisely, highlighting schemes (UDLs). This pseudocode plug-in is a custom-defined-language that provides syntax highlighting. It has been built for the Computer Science syllabuses of Cambridge International Assessment Education, specifically A Level 9608 and IGCSE 0478.

## Recommended YouTube channels
Some YouTube channels were also particularly useful to me and have been listed here. The keen student is also likely to find them enjoyable, so it is recommended to check them out. Many of them are structured as series, so it may be useful to follow through rather than watch individual videos (if you feel you have the adequate pre-requisites, feel free to try individual videos).

| Channel | Description |
| -- | -- |
| [Ben Eater](https://www.youtube.com/user/eaterbc) | Teaches low-level electronics and fundamentals, assuming little background |
| [Computer Science](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSX3MR0gnKDxyXAyljWzm0Q) | Fundamentals of computers in lucid explanations; seems to cover A Level and GCSE syllabuses |
| [Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/user/Computerphile) | Interesting facts about computers and programming explained by various experts |
| [Kevin Darrah](https://www.youtube.com/user/kdarrah1234) | Builds and explains about projects using microcontrollers |
| [Missing Semester](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuXy5tCgEninup9cGplbiFw) | Series of lectures from [MIT CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu) about using common tools, such as CLIs, version control, and IDEs |
| [TED-Ed](https://www.youtube.com/user/TEDEducation) | General educational channel but the series [Think Like A Coder](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJicmE8fK0EgogMqDYMgcADT1j5b911or) covers basic programming concepts with an engaging storyline |
| [Tom Scott](https://www.youtube.com/user/enyay) | Not strictly a computer channel, but the playlist [The Basics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL96C35uN7xGLLeET0dOWaKHkAlPsrkcha) talks about useful facts about computers and programming |

## About this page, and its author
I love robotics, and Computer Science was a natural choice for me at IGCSE and A Level (I scored A* at both). I built some tools and wrote notes to aide my learning journey, and documented them thoroughly so that they can be published (on this page!). The hope is that some students/teachers can re-discover their passion for computers through these resources, and get assistance obtaining the grade they deserve. All sorts of feedback and suggestions are welcome, and may be submitted by [opening an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue) or [pulling a request](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) on the repository for this page via GitHub.
