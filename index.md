# 9608, 0478: Programming and Problem-solving

### Disclaimer about all resources here
While all reasonable efforts have been made to ensure full compatibility with the syllabuses (and the author himself uses these for their own practice and study), these are **not official** resources and have not been endorsed by Cambridge International Assessment Education for any syllabus. Please use them at your own discretion. The author will not be responsible for any syllabus mismatches.

## Built resources

Most of my resources that involve programming are written for Python. Some resources are made using [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/), which allows me to make interactive notes for Python: you can read the explanation and then try out examples immediately.

Brief descriptions of the resources I built alongside my IGCSE [0478](https://www.cambridgeinternational.org/programmes-and-qualifications/cambridge-igcse-computer-science-0478/) and A Level [9608](https://www.cambridgeinternational.org/programmes-and-qualifications/cambridge-international-as-and-a-level-computer-science-9608/) courses:

* Two [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks that guide a learner through all<span style="color:red">\*</span> aspects related to programming on the A Level syllabus 9608 (also available using [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) and [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) which can run in a web browser, so the viewer does not have to install any software to view them). Please know that these are not yet as comprehensive or approachable as I would like, but should be by about the middle of year 2021.
* A plug-in for the text editor [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) that enables prettytyping (syntax highlighting) for pseudocode as per the CAIE specifications.
* An exemplary solved pre-release material for IGCSE.
* Two exemplary solved pre-release materials for A Level (one for AS Level; one for A2).

Leveraging experience from [Python](https://www.python.org/), [LabVIEW](http://labview.com/) (language: G) and [Arduino](https://arduino.cc/) (language: C++) programming, care is taken, where possible, to ensure that concepts are communicated in a manner so that they develop transferable skills.

The table below has hyperlinks to access the aforementioned resources. Chances are these will work for newer syllabuses (A Level [9618](https://www.cambridgeinternational.org/programmes-and-qualifications/cambridge-international-as-and-a-level-computer-science-9618/); IGCSE [0984](https://www.cambridgeinternational.org/programmes-and-qualifications/cambridge-igcse-9-1-computer-science-0984/)), and possibly those from other boards too, but **this has not been checked**, and topics must be matched independently by the end-user.

## Recommended YouTube channels
Some YouTube channels were also particularly useful to me and have been listed here. The keen student is also likely to find them enjoyable, so it is recommended to check them out. Many of them are structured as series, so it may be useful to follow through rather than watch individual videos (if you feel you have the adequate pre-requisites, feel free to try individual videos).

| Channel | Description |
| -- | -- |
| [Ben Eater](https://www.youtube.com/user/eaterbc) | Teaches low-level electronics and fundamentals, assuming little background |
| [Computer Science](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSX3MR0gnKDxyXAyljWzm0Q) | Fundamentals of computers in lucid explanations; seems to cover A Level and GCSE syllabuses |
| [Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/user/Computerphile) | Interesting facts about computers and programming explained by various experts |
| [Kevin Darrah](https://www.youtube.com/user/kdarrah1234) | Builds and explains about projects using microcontrollers |
| [Missing Semester](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuXy5tCgEninup9cGplbiFw) | Series of lectures from [MIT CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu) about using the command line |
| [TED-Ed](https://www.youtube.com/user/TEDEducation) | General educational channel but the series [Think Like A Coder](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJicmE8fK0EgogMqDYMgcADT1j5b911or) covers basic programming concepts with an engaging storyline |
| [Tom Scott](https://www.youtube.com/user/enyay) | Not strictly a computer channel, but the playlist [The Basics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL96C35uN7xGLLeET0dOWaKHkAlPsrkcha) talks about useful facts about computers and programming |

## About this page, and its author
I love robotics, and Computer Science was a natural choice for me at IGCSE and A Level (I scored A* at both). I built some tools and wrote notes to aide my learning journey, and documented them thoroughly so that they can be published (on this page!). The hope is that some students/teachers can re-discover their passion for computers through these resources, and get assistance obtaining the grade they deserve. All sorts of feedback and suggestions are welcome, and may be submitted by [opening an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue) or [pulling a request](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) on the repository for this page via GitHub.
