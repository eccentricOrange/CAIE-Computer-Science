# How to contribute to this project
-  **Clearly define all issues and pull requests.** All issues/PRs should have clear explanations (in English) about their intent and content. It's okay if you're not perfectly formal, but make your best attempt.
-  **Make sure you search existing issues before opening yours.** This is just to avoid duplicates.
