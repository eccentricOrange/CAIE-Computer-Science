# Recommended YouTube channels
Some YouTube channels were also particularly useful to me and have been listed here. The keen student is also likely to find them enjoyable, so it is recommended to check them out. Many of them are structured as series, so it may be useful to follow through rather than watch individual videos (if you feel you have the adequate pre-requisites, feel free to try individual videos).

| Channel | Description |
| -- | -- |
| [Ben Eater](https://www.youtube.com/user/eaterbc) | Teaches low-level electronics and fundamentals, assuming little background |
| [Brian Will](https://www.youtube.com/user/briantwill) | In-depth discussion of fairly advanced concepts. Mostly irrelevant to syllabus, but fairly interesting and useful for applications. |
| [Computer Science](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSX3MR0gnKDxyXAyljWzm0Q) | Fundamentals of computers in lucid explanations; seems to cover A Level and GCSE syllabuses |
| [Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/user/Computerphile) | Interesting facts about computers and programming explained by various experts |
| [CS 50](https://www.youtube.com/c/cs50) | Great and rigorous introduction to CS by Harvard University. Please see [Tip #010-05-11-2022](/tips.html#001-09-10-2021) |
| [Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/c/Fireship) | Somewhat intense videos, largely about various tools used in web-development. Not very relevant to A Levels, but might be interesting for some students. |
| [Kevin Darrah](https://www.youtube.com/user/kdarrah1234) | Builds and explains about projects using microcontrollers |
| [mCoding](https://www.youtube.com/c/mCodingWithJamesMurphy) | Explains unintuitive Python and C/C++ concepts in unconventional but effective ways. Great for general tips/best practices that go well beyond the syllabus. |
| [Missing Semester](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuXy5tCgEninup9cGplbiFw) | Series of lectures from [MIT CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu) about using common tools, such as CLIs, version control, and IDEs |
| [PwnFunction](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW6MNdOsqv2E9AjQkv9we7A) | Mostly covers security exploits. |
| [Reducible](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK8XIGR5kRidIw2fWqwyHRA) | Core CS concepts with excellent presentation and thoughtful exposition; slightly beyond the scope of A Levels. |
| [TED-Ed](https://www.youtube.com/user/TEDEducation) | General educational channel but the series [Think Like A Coder](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJicmE8fK0EgogMqDYMgcADT1j5b911or) covers basic programming concepts with an engaging storyline |
| [Tom Scott](https://www.youtube.com/user/enyay) | Not strictly a computer channel, but the playlist [The Basics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL96C35uN7xGLLeET0dOWaKHkAlPsrkcha) talks about useful facts about computers and programming |
