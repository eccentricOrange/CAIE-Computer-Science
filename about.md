# About

## About this page, and its author
I love robotics, and Computer Science was a natural choice for me at IGCSE and A Level (I scored A* at both). I built some tools and wrote notes to aide my learning journey, and documented them thoroughly so that they can be published (on this page!). The hope is that some students/teachers can re-discover their passion for computers through these resources, and get assistance obtaining the grade they deserve. All sorts of feedback and suggestions are welcome, and may be submitted by [opening an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue) or [pulling a request](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) on the repository for this page via GitHub.
